In the first semester of my master journey, I worked as a data researcher at Wang Lab for Biomedicines at Washington University in St. Louis.

In my role, I took charge of managing the storage of experimental patient data within an SQL server. This included writing more than 50 SQL queries designed to extract data that specifically addressed the needs of the UPI team.

Additionally, I embarked on a significant data modeling project. Using Python, I developed a signal inverse fitting model to handle a substantial volume of noisy water molecular diffusion data. Impressively, this model achieved an exceptional 98% fitting accuracy, demonstrating its robustness and reliability.

Furthermore, I leveraged Monte Carlo Simulation techniques to create randomized diffusion weighted imaging signal data. Through iterative refinement, I enhanced the model's performance to achieve an 84% fitting accuracy. The culmination of this effort was the successful implementation of the improved model, making a valuable contribution to the ongoing research endeavors of the dMRI team.
