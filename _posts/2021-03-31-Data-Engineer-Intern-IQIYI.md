During the summer in 2021, I worked as a data engineer intern at iQIYI.

I played a crucial role in data management and analytics, contributing significantly to our team's success. Here's a detailed account of my key responsibilities and accomplishments:

1. **Data Extraction and ETL Pipeline Management**
I executed close to 70 SQL queries to extract valuable data, including user gross data and video view data, from our Oracle database. To streamline our data processing, I defined ETL pipelines using a combination of PySpark and SQL within Spark. Additionally, I closely monitored task dependencies and ensured the weekly execution of these pipelines using Airflow.

2. **Data Transformation and Modeling**
To enhance data usability and insights, I created DBT (Data Build Tool) models that defined data transformations using SQL code. These models played a pivotal role in processing complex soil datasets containing over 200 features. The processed data was seamlessly loaded into Google BigQuery on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), enabling efficient data analysis.

3. **Data Visualization and User Activity Analysis**
I successfully orchestrated the migration of data from Excel to Power BI, facilitating a more dynamic and interactive data visualization process. Using Power BI, I constructed a visualization dashboard focused on Daily Active Users (DAU) and page view data. This dashboard provided automated analysis of user activity, offering valuable insights for decision-making processes.

4. **Retention Score Prediction and Recommendations**
In the realm of predictive analytics, I took on the challenge of developing and optimizing a retention score prediction model. Through meticulous work in Python, I managed to reduce the Mean Squared Error (MSE) to an impressive 0.001. This accomplishment was achieved by incorporating a monomial expression into the Linear Regression model. The results of this model provided valuable recommendations to the Business Intelligence (BI) group and supported the decision-making efforts of the project manager, ultimately contributing to our team's success.
