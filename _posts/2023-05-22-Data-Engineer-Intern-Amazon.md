In the summer of 2023, I had the honor of working as a Data Engineer Intern at Amazon. It's been an absolute pleasure to be a part of Amazon and the PATOE team. 

Here's a breakdown of my key contributions:

1. **Data Transfer and Storage Optimization**
I efficiently transferred structured data from the Andes Data Lake to our Amazon Data Warehouse Redshift clusters. This migration alone saved the business 3 hours every week.

2. **ETL Pipeline Development**
In response to requests from our finance teams, I developed and fine-tuned robust ETL pipelines. These enhancements led to a notable reduction in data processing time.

3. **AWS Integration**
Leveraging AWS Glue, I designed an ETL process that seamlessly converted JSON datasets into CSV format. Subsequently, I stored the output files in an S3 Bucket. To ensure smooth operations, I also monitored the applications using CloudWatch.

4. **SQL Query Execution**
I executed more than 100 complex SQL queries utilizing DataGrip. This allowed me to extract data from Amazon Redshift and integrate it into Power BI. The result was the creation of AI-driven Power BI dashboards tailored for the Amazon Delivery HR team. This automation led to an impressive 80% decrease in workload for our analysis team.

5. **Kafka Integration**
I played a crucial role in supporting the integration of data streams using Kafka. This real-time data analysis capability proved invaluable in tracking associates' attrition in line with stakeholder objectives. Additionally, I provided vital assistance to the project manager, resulting in an astounding daily time savings of 380 hours for our North American Amazon factory workers.
