During the summer in 2021, I worked as a data engineer intern at AVIC Securities.

I played a pivotal role in enhancing our data integration and analytics processes by spearheading several key initiatives:

1. **Streamlining Data Integration and Transformation**
Firstly, I developed a total of five automatic ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines using SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services) and Azure Data Factory. These pipelines seamlessly integrated data from more than ten disparate sources. Moreover, I conducted comprehensive data transformations to generate new metrics, ensuring data consistency and accuracy throughout our systems.

2. **Real-time Insights with Azure Stream Analytics**
To further bolster our real-time data capabilities, I leveraged Azure Stream Analytics. This allowed us to process data in real-time and extract valuable insights promptly, contributing to more informed decision-making.

3. **Data Quality Assurance and Testing**
In addition to data processing enhancements, I prioritized data quality by meticulously designing and implementing data validation and unit testing procedures. These measures ensured that our data remained reliable and error-free, safeguarding the integrity of our analytics efforts.

4. **Dynamic Data Visualization and Stakeholder Engagement**
Lastly, I extended my contributions to data visualization, employing Tableau to create dynamic data dashboards. These dashboards effectively conveyed the weekly changing rates of bond and currency data, providing our team with critical insights. Furthermore, I regularly presented these insights during weekly meetings, ensuring that our stakeholders remained informed and engaged in our data-driven decision-making process.
