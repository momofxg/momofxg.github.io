During my second year of high school, I worked as a data researcher at Brain Computer Interface Lab in Tsinghua University.

I played a pivotal role in a unique and innovative project involving brain-computer interface (BCI). Here's an overview of my key responsibilities and contributions:

1. **Brain Signal Analysis and Data Transformation**
One of my primary tasks was to extract and differentiate brain signal patterns when individuals issued movement orders in four different directions. To achieve this, I meticulously cleaned and processed the data using Python. This involved transforming the data into a CSV format while simultaneously deciphering the intended movement directions based on the brain signals captured. This step was crucial in bridging the gap between brain activity and actionable commands.

2. **BCI Pipeline Development for Virtual Car Control**
In a significant milestone, I spearheaded the creation of a sophisticated pipeline designed to transfer data and control a virtual car in various directions. This pipeline was the linchpin in achieving a seamless brain-computer interface. Through its implementation, we were able to translate the distinct brain signal patterns I had identified into precise commands for the virtual car, enabling it to navigate in different directions with remarkable accuracy.

This project not only showcased the potential of brain-computer interfaces but also underscored the innovative strides we made in harnessing brain signals for practical applications, paving the way for exciting possibilities in the field of human-computer interaction.
