When I was in my sophomore year, I attended the Mathematical Contest in Modeling 2020 and finally won Honorable Mention Prize.

I played a crucial role in a multifaceted project focused on enhancing our understanding of reviews and their impact. Here's a comprehensive overview of my contributions and responsibilities:

1. **Designing a Weighted Model for Review Helpfulness**
Central to our efforts was the design and construction of a weighted model that assessed the helpfulness of reviews. To achieve this, I leveraged the SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) algorithm and applied Ridge Regression techniques. This approach allowed us to assign meaningful weights to reviews, shedding light on their relative importance and utility.

2. **NLP-based Feature Extraction and Predictive Modeling**
To further enrich our analysis, I embarked on a natural language processing (NLP) journey. I employed a sophisticated machine learning model to extract key word features from helpful reviews. These features served as valuable inputs for predictive modeling, specifically geared towards forecasting helpful votes. This innovative approach enabled us to gauge the impact of specific words and phrases on the helpfulness of reviews.

3. **Time Series Analysis for Weighted Reputation Prediction**
In addition to review-related metrics, I delved into time series analysis to predict the weighted reputation of our products or services. This involved analyzing data over time to discern patterns and trends that contributed to reputation changes. By employing this method, we gained valuable insights into how our reputation evolved over time.

In summary, my involvement in this project encompassed designing a weighted model for review helpfulness, leveraging NLP for feature extraction and predictive modeling, and applying time series analysis to predict weighted reputation changes. Together, these efforts significantly enhanced our ability to assess and understand the dynamics of reviews and their impact on our products or services.
